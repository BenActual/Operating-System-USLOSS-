# Operating System (USLOSS)

This project is a custom **educational operating system** built as part of my senior capstone in Computer Science at the University of Arizona.  
It uses the **USLOSS kernel framework** and implements core OS concepts including process management, scheduling, memory handling, and system calls.

## âœ¨ Features Implemented
- **Process Scheduling**  
  Implemented round-robin scheduling, context switching, and priority management.
- **System Calls**  
  Added system call interface for process creation, termination, and inter-process communication (IPC).
- **Memory Management**  
  Developed page table support, virtual memory handling, and allocation routines.
- **Concurrency & Synchronization**  
  Built synchronization primitives and tested safe process interaction.
- **Testing & Debugging**  
  Wrote unit tests to validate kernel functionality and concurrency safety.

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** C  
- **Kernel Base:** [USLOSS educational kernel])  
- **Tools:** GCC, GDB, Make, WSL Linux
